# N8N Automation - Whatsapp Group Records Archiving in Postgres
This project was created to display information about the WhatsApp groups of publicity campaigns. It aimed to gather insights on which messages in the groups had better engagement, which messages caused people to leave (so that we could avoid those), the most important days for acquiring new members, and the distribution of people across each group. I automated the process of retrieving new data from WhatsApp using N8N, created Postgres relational tables and materialized views, and connected the data to a Looker Studio dashboard.
